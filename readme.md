## Server for Project Pablo

This server has an endpoint that accepts image as input and translates it to command strings to be sent to the arduino via bluetooth.
Similary, another endpoint also exists that takes in code and translates it to a list of basic commands to be sent to the arduino via bluetooth.

Bluetooth communication is to be done via the client device itself, however, the plan is to use the bluetooth features availble on raspberry pi if we plan to use a device without bluetooth features.
